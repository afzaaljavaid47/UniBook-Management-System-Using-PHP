## üíª Abstract
The UniBook Management System is a comprehensive web application developed using PHP designed to manage university book inventory, facilitate book lending, and streamline administrative tasks. This system leverages PHP for server-side operations and MySQL for database management, ensuring efficient data handling and reliable performance.

The implementation involves using PHP to manage backend processes and MySQL for data storage. Users interact with the system through a web interface developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing administrators to manage book inventories and students to browse and borrow books.

## üî¨ Purpose
The primary purposes of developing the UniBook Management System are:

- **Efficient Book Inventory Management**: Keeps track of book stock, categories, and availability.
- **Streamlined Book Lending Process**: Facilitates easy borrowing and returning of books, ensuring accurate record-keeping.
- **User Management**:

 Manages user accounts, including students and administrative staff, ensuring secure access and user-specific functionalities.
- **Enhanced Communication**: Facilitates communication between library staff and students through automated notifications and alerts.
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Provides detailed reports and analytics on book usage, lending history, and inventory levels, aiding in better decision-making.

## ‚ú¥Ô∏è Development Languages

1. **Programming Languages**: PHP
2. **Frontend Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
3. **Tools**: Visual Studio Code
4. **Database**: MySQL

## Implementation

The implementation involves the following steps:

### Frontend

1. **User Interface Design**: Create web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for various functionalities such as book browsing, borrowing, returning, and user account management.
2. **Form Handling**: Develop forms for user input (e.g., book search form, borrow/return form) and ensure data validation using JavaScript.

### Backend

1. **Database Design**: Create a MySQL database with tables for books, users, transactions, categories, and other necessary entities.
2. **PHP Scripts**: Develop PHP scripts to handle user requests, perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the database, and manage sessions.
3. **Search and Filter Functionality**: Implement search and filter functionality to help users easily find books based on various criteria.
4. **Security Measures**: Implement security measures such as input sanitization, authentication, and authorization to protect the system from vulnerabilities.

### Deployment

1. **Server Setup**: Set up a web server (e.g., Apache) and configure it to run PHP scripts.
2. **Database Configuration**: Deploy the MySQL database on the server and configure it for remote access if needed.
3. **Testing and Debugging**: Thoroughly test the system for bugs and fix any issues to ensure smooth operation.
4. **Launch**: Deploy the application to a live server and make it accessible to users.
